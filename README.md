# Computer-Vision-Projects

- This repository is for archiving the codes that I've done to study some of the very classical computer vision projects.
- Most of them are focusing on re-inventing OpenCV functions, to work almost the same as the original ones.
- Please refer to the documents embedded in each folder.
